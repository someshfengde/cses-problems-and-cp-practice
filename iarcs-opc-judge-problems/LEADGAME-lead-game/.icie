Well, there is more to it, but for our purposes this is sufficient.</p>\n<p>The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds have been played, the total score of each player is determined by adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher total score is declared the winner.</p>\n<p>The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the end of any round in the game is declared the winner.</p>\n<p>Consider the following score sheet for a game with $5$ rounds:</p>\n<p>$ $</p>\n<pre><code>Round     Player 1       Player 2\n\n  1         140             82\n  2          89            134 \n  3          90            110 \n  4         112            106\n  5          88             90 \n</code></pre>\n<p>$ $</p>\n<p>The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after each round for this game is given below:</p>\n<p>$ $</p>\n<pre><code>Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead\n\n  1          140             82       Player 1     58\n  2          229            216       Player 1     13\n  3          319            326       Player 2      7\n  4          431            432       Player 2      1\n  5          519            522       Player 2      3\n</code></pre>\n<p>$ $</p>\n<p>The winner of this game is Player $1$ as he had the maximum lead ($58$ at the end of round $1$) during the game.</p>\n<p>Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will always be a single winner. That is, there are no ties.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input will contain a single integer N ($N \\leq 10000$) indicating the number of rounds in the game. Lines $2,3,...,N+1$ describe the scores of the two players in the $N$ rounds. Line $i+1$ contains two integer $S_i$ and $T_i$, the scores of the Player $1$ and $2$ respectively, in round $i$.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers $W$ and $L$, where $W$ is $1$ or $2$ and indicates the winner and $L$ is the maximum lead attained by the winner.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$50 %$ of test data satisfy $N \\leq 1000$.</li>\n<li>$1 \\leq N \\leq 10000$</li>\n<li>$1 \\leq S_i \\leq 1000$</li>\n<li>$1 \\leq T_i \\leq 1000$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample input:</h3>\n<pre><code>5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample output:</h3>\n<pre><code>1 58\n</code></pre>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
