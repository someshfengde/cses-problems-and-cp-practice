Her brother Nikhil has played a rather nasty prank. He has glued together pairs of tiles with 0 written on them. Lavanya now has square tiles with 1 on them and rectangular tiles with two 0's on them, made up of two square tiles with 0 stuck together). Thus, she can no longer make all possible binary sequences using these tiles.</p>\n<p>To amuse herself, Lavanya has decided to pick a number $N$ and try and construct as many binary sequences of length $N$ as possible using her collection of tiles. For example if $N$ = 1, she can only make the sequence 1. For $N$=2, she can make 11 and 00. For $N$=4, there are 5 possibilities: 0011, 0000, 1001, 1100 and 1111.</p>\n<p>Lavanya would like you to write a program to compute the number of arrangements possible with $N$ tiles so that she can verify that she has generated all of them. Since she cannot count beyond 15746, it is sufficient to report this number modulo 15746.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>A single line with a single integer $N$.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>A single integer indicating the number of binary sequences of length $N$, modulo 15746, that Lavanya can make using her tiles.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<p>You may assume that $N \\leq$ 1000000.</p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre><code>4\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre><code>5\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>This corresponds to the example discussed above.</p>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
