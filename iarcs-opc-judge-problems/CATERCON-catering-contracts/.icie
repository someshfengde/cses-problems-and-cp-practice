Contractors will be allowed to bid for the catering contract at more than one station. However, to avoid monopolistic price-fixing, the government has declared that no contractor may bid for a pair of neighbouring stations.</p>\n<p>The railway network has exactly one route between any pair of stations. Each station is directly connected by a railway line to at most $50$ neighbouring stations.</p>\n<p>To help contractors plan their bids, the government has provided data on the number of passengers who pass through each station each year. Contractors would like to bid for stations with a higher volume of passenger traffic to increase their turnover.</p>\n<p>For instance, suppose the railway network is as follows, where the volume of passenger traffic is indicated by the side of each station.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O6gBd7X.jpg\" alt=\"1-1\" title=\"Figure\" /></p>\n<p>In this network, the best option for the contractor is to bid for stations $1, 2, 5$ and $6$, for a total passenger volume of $90$.</p>\n<p>Your task is to choose a set of stations that the contractor should bid for so that the total volume of traffic across all the stations in the bid is maximized.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,...,N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2, 3,..., N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i, 1 \\leq i \\leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>The output should be a single integer, corresponding to the total volume of traffic across the set of stations in the optimal bid made by the contractor.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$. </li>\n<li>Each railway station has at most $50$ neighbours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre><code>6\n10\n20\n25\n40\n30\n30\n4 5\n1 3\n3 4\n2 3\n6 4\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre><code>90\n</code></pre>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
