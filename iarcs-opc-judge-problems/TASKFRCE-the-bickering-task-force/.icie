The king was\nno believer in democracy (understandably) and did not wish to\nshare any information regarding the running of his country even\nwith the nobles in his court. He had a inner circle (a\n<em>cabal</em>) consisting of a few old friends from his youth\nand couple of proteges and ran the kingdom with their help.  It\nwas however a benevolent dictatorship and thus there was hardly a\nprotest either in the court or among the subjects.</p>\n<p>The king's sons and potential successors were however of\ndubious attitude and quality. Clearly, dictatorship of the\nincompetent was the future of the country if the king were to\nabdicate or die.  Some of the younger nobles banded together and\nconfronted the king and demanded openness.</p>\n<p>The king promised to appoint a Task Force with members\nselected from among the nobles to oversee the administration of\nthe country.  However he wished to choose its members in such a\nway that they would waste all their time fighting each other,\nleaving them no opportunity to introduce any changes in the way\nthe country was being run.</p>\n<p>His able advisor, the wily prime minister, gave him a list of\nall the pairs of nobles who hated each other.  The king then\nwanted the minister to pick as large a Task Force as possible (so\nthat his generosity was evident), in such a way that each member\nof the Task Force hates at least $K$ other members (where\n$K$ was a number to be determined by the king).  The Task\nForce cannot be empty.</p>\n<p>Note that whenever a pair of nobles &quot;$A$ and\n$B$&quot; appears in the prime minister's list, it means that\n$A$ hates $B$ and, symmetrically, $B$ hates\n$A$.</p>\n<p>Suppose there are $8$ nobles and the prime minister's list says\nthat the following pairs of nobles &quot;hate each other&quot;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$1$ and $2$</li>\n<li>$1$ and $3$</li>\n<li>$1$ and $5$</li>\n<li>$1$ and $6$</li>\n<li>$2$ and $5$</li>\n<li>$2$ and $6$</li>\n<li>$3$ and $4$</li>\n<li>$3$ and $5$</li>\n<li>$4$ and $6$</li>\n<li>$4$ and $7$</li>\n<li>$5$ and $6$</li>\n<li>$7$ and $8$</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For $K = 2$, ${ 1,2,3,4,5,6 }$ is the largest possible\nTask Force in which everyone hates at least $2$ others. In this\nTask Force, $1$ hates $2$,$3$,$5$ and $6$, $4$ hates $3$ and $6$, and so on.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the king sets $K$ to $3$ then\n${ 1,2,5,6 }$ would be largest Task Force in which everyone hates at\nleast $3$ others.  For $K = 4$ or more, as you can check,\nthere is no way to group the nobles so that every member hates\n$K$ or more other members in the group.</p>\n<p>Your task is to help the minister determine the size of the\nlargest Task Force that can be formed from a given set of nobles\nin accordance with the king's wishes.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains three integers\n$N$, $M$ and $K$.  $N$ is\nthe number of nobles, $M$ is the number of pairs of nobles\nwho hate each other and $K$ is the minimum number of members that\neach member of the chosen group must hate within the group.</p>\n<p>The next $M$ lines (lines $2,...,M+1$) describe\nthe &quot;hate&quot; relationship. Line $i+1$ contains two space\nseparated integers $A_i$ and\n$B_i$, with $1 \\leq A_i &lt; B_i \\leq N$, indicating that nobles\n$A_i$ and $B_i$ hate each\nother.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the output must contain either <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>.</p>\n<p>A <code>YES</code> in the first line indicates that it is\npossible to select a Task Force in which each member hates at\nleast $K$ others. In this case, the second line of the\noutput contains an integer $S$ giving the size of the\nlargest such Task Force.</p>\n<p>A <code>NO</code> indicates that it is not possible to form a\nTask Force in which each member hates at least $K$ others.\nIn this case the output consists of just one line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\leq N &lt; 3000$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>\n<pre><code>8 12 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 5\n1 6\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6\n4 7\n5 6\n7 8 \n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>\n<pre><code>YES\n6\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>\n<pre><code>8 12 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 5\n1 6\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6\n4 7\n5 6\n7 8\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>\n<pre><code>YES\n4\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Input 3</h3>\n<pre><code>8 12 4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 5\n1 6\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n4 6\n4 7\n5 6\n7 8 \n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output 3</h3>\n<pre><code>NO\n</code></pre>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
