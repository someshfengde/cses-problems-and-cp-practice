A pyramid is built by placing a square block, say $N$ cms by $N$ cms, at the base, place another square block $N-1$ cms by $N-1$ cms on top of that, a square block of $N-2$ cms by $N-2$ cms on top of that and so on, ending with a $1$ cm by $1$ cm block on top. The height of such a pyramid is $N$.</p>\n<p>Indraneel has with him $M$ rectangular blocks of wood. He is willing to shape them into square blocks. His only cutting tool is a shaver that can be used to shave off the wood from any edge to reduce its length. This means that he can never get two square blocks from a single rectangular block.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose the dimensions of the rectangular blocks available with Indraneel are $8 \\times 8$, $2 \\times 8$, $2 \\times 1$  and $2 \\times 2$. Then, he can build a pyramid of height $3$ (the $2 \\times 1$ block can be shaved to give a $1 \\times 1$ block, and the $8 \\times 8$ block can be shaved down to a $3 \\times 3$ block.)</p>\n<p>Given the dimensions of the blocks available, your task is determine the height of the tallest pyramid that Indraneel can build.</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $M$ indicating the number of blocks of wood available. This is followed by $M$ lines of input (lines $2, 3,...,M+1$) each containing the description of a block. A block is described by two integers $i$ and $j$ indicating the lengths of the two sides of the block. No block is longer or wider than $1000000$ cms.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>A single line with a single integer indicating the height of the tallest pyramid that Indraneel can build.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\leq M \\leq 1000000$.</li>\n<li>All block dimensions are bounded by $1000000$ cms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre><code>4\n8 8\n2 8\n2 1\n2 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre><code>3\n</code></pre>\n<aside style='background: #f8f8f8;padding: 10px 15px;'><div>All submissions for this problem are available.</div></aside>\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
